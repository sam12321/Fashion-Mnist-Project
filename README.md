# Fashion-Mnist-Project
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.
Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for 
benchmarking machine learning algorithms.It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.
# Goal
Our main goal in this project is to create a model which can identify what kind of fashion item is shown to it in the given image. 
# Datasets
The datasets are directly downloaded in the project using tensorflow.However if you want to directly download them you can using this link: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist
